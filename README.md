# Hyper-V-Toggle-Script
A script to toggle between enabling or disabling Hyper-V.

Created for gamers who use Faceit AntiCheat but also uses Hyper-V for dev work, Faceit AntiCheat requires you to disable Hyper-V in order to run it.

Will ask you to press enter before continuing each step.

Auto Restarts your computer at the end of the script.
(You can just close the script before you press enter for this step if you do not wish to restart now.)
